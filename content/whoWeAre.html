				<h3>Drs. Ido van der Heijden</h3>
<p>
Over a period of 35 years, Ido has established a reputation as an expert in personal and leadership development work in organisations. He has worked with several hundred senior executives and executive teams worldwide, always focusing on improving peoples’ understanding of themselves and their colleagues.</p>
<p>
He is a Visiting Fellow at Cranfield School of Management, where he has been responsible for the flagship programme <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/som/open-executive-programmes/the-praxis-centre-for-leadership-development/personal-transformation-for-leaders" target="_blank">‘Personal Transformation for Leaders’</a> since 1981, and which he and Cranfield continue to offer.</p>
<p>
Ido graduated as a clinical psychologist in 1976 at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, and since then has received extensive postgraduate training in several different forms of psychotherapy. His knowledge and experience covers a wide spectrum of approaches to human development, ranging from Freudian Psychology to NLP and Meditation.</p>
<p>
Being the son of Dutch Holocaust survivors has inspired Ido to make self-awareness the main focus of his work with leaders. He combines an ability to gain rapid insight into people with the skill and sensitivity required to address their issues in a direct and supportive way. His penetrating, humorous style helps people to be more open than they usually are. Honed over a lifetime of practice, Ido’s natural gifts and talents have been proven over the years to create lasting and meaningful change in individuals and teams.</p>
<p>
Ido lives in East Sussex and plays the cello and the saxophone.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>
Daniela now lives and works in the UK, is a visiting lecturer at Cranfield School of Management and works internationally with senior executives and executive teams. In her work Daniela combines clear logical thinking with a deep understanding of human emotions. Her irresistible questions help people to explore new perspectives on their life and work.</p>
<p>
Daniela is the mother of three daughters, born 1976, 1978 and 1997 and has five grandchildren. She has a special interest in education and is developing web based software for children with learning difficulties in math.</p>
